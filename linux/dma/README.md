# Direct memory access

For evaluation of the ADC performance, data is streamed to memory using direct
memory access (DMA) with a kernel device driver. This driver is based on the
[**DMA Proxy Prototype** driver](https://github.com/Xilinx-Wiki-Projects/software-prototypes)
by Xilinx, Inc. This driver is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.
