# TODOs

This is a list of ideas and tangents that I might want to consider in the
future:

- [X] Set output driver register to `0x1` to double the output strength of the
    SDO pins of the ADC. Might help with DIO timing and the level converter.
- [ ] Use the digital gain to change the input range without hardware changes
    and evaluate performance.
